Hello this is Siyang. This is for our FYP project.
The ball.py and face1.py are our testing code in the very beginning. There are more in the repository of KatsikaTheHalf. We are currently using faceif.py as the lib and Face_client as the main code. faceif.py is built based on the comment from Dr. Chu.
This readme file is our coding log.
